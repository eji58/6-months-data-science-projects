# 6-months-data-science-projects

## Section 1. Fundamentals
1. Variables : explain  what variables are and how to create concise and meaningful variables.
2. Strings : learn about string data and some basic string operations.
3. Numbers : introduce the commonly-used number types including integers and floating-point numbers.
4. Booleans : explain the Boolean data type, falsy and truthy values in Python.
5. Constants : show how to define constants in Python.
6. Comments : learn how to make notes in your code.
7. Type conversion : learn how to convert a value of one type to another e.g., converting a string to a number.



## Section 2. Operators
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

1. Arithmetic operators : to compare two values.
2. Assignment operators : to assign values to variables.
3. Comparison operators : to compare two values
4. Logical operators :  to combine conditional statements.
5. Identity operators : to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.
6. Membership operators : to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
7. Bitwise operators : to compare (binary) numbers



## Section 3. Data Collections
python used collection to store data, for example, lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, all of which are built-in collections.

1. Lists : a list is a collection of ***ordered*** and ***mutable*** data and  allow duplicates
2. Tuples : a tuple is an ***ordered*** and ***immutable*** collection of data and  allow duplicates
3. Sets : a set is an ***unordered*** and ***mutable*** collection and  does not allow duplicates.
4. Dictionaries : a dictionary is an ***unordered*** and ***mutable*** collection of data that stores data in key-value pairs and keys do not allow duplicates.



## Section 4. Control flow 
1. Conditional statement (if then and expression ) : learn how to execute a code block based on a condition.
2. Loops (iterations, lambda) : show how to execute a code block as long as a condition is True.


## Section 6. Programming Paradigms:
1. Functional Programming 
2. Object-Oriented Programming (objects and classes)


## Section 7. Handling expations
1. try…except – show how to handle exceptions more gracefully using the try…except statement.
2. try…except…finally – learn how to execute a code block whether an exception occurs or not.
3. try…except…else – explain to how to use the try…except…else statement to control the follow of the program in case of exceptions.


## Section 8. NumPy 
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

1. Basic:  
2. Random: 
3. Ufunc : show how to create ufunc, this function take the input and output as arrays.


## Section 9. Pandas 
1. Basic
2. Cleaning Data
3. Advanced

## Section 10. API (Application Programming Interface)
1. Building API
2. Structure of an API 
3. oprations of an API (PUT, POST, DELETE)
4. Using Postman
